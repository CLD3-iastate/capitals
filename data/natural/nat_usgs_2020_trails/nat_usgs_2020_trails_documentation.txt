US Counties Census Bureau shapefile here: https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles/index.php?year=2019&layergroup=Counties+%28and+equivalent%29

Methodology:

1. Added to QGIS project the tl_2019_us_county.shp file (from Census Bureau county shapefile) and the three state Trans_TrailSegment.shp files for IA, OR, VA (from USGS state transportation zips)
2. Split each trails shapefile into segments by county using Vector -> Geoprocessing -> Intersection, with Trans_TrailSegment as the input layer and tl_2019_us_county as the overlay layer
3. Merged the three new layers created in step 2 using Vector -> Data Management Tools -> Merge Vector Layers and selecting the three layers created in step 2 as the input layers
4. Layer created in step 3 exported as a new shapefile containing trail segments by county for all three original state trail shapefiles
