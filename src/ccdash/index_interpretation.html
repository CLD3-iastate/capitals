<b>Interpreting the Index</b>
<p>
Composite indices listed on the left capture area community capital. Each composite index is based on multiple measures 
that were selected on the basis of prior research and Extension community input.
<p>
For measures composing each index, we compute quintile cut-offs after reverse-coding as 
appropriate to capture assets or deficits. For composites capturing assets, county placement in a 
higher quintile indicates a better relative position on the indicator compared to other counties; 
that is, it suggests higher community capital. Conversely, for composites capturing deficits,
county placement in a higher quintile indicates a worse relative position compared to the county's 
counterparts, and indicates lower community capital. To arrive at the final index value, we average 
county quintile placement across the measures composing the index.
<p>
The more times a county places in the highest quintiles on relevant measures, the higher 
the index value, with a theoretical range of 1 (always placing in the lowest quintile) through 5 (always placing
in the highest quintile). For composites capturing assets, with index maps shown in green, this suggests higher 
community capital. For composites capturing deficits, with index maps shown in brown, this suggests lower community capital.

The map on the first panel below displays values for the selected index at county level for your chosen state.
The map and boxplot on the second panel display information about the measures used to compose your selected index.
